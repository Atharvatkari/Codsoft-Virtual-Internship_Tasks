# Number Guessing Game in Java :
   This Java program implements a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 99, and the player tries to guess it. The Game class manages the game logic, including 
   generating a random number, taking user input via Scanner, and providing feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, with the number of 
   attempts tracked and displayed upon success. This project is a practical example of Java fundamentals, covering concepts like classes, objects, random number generation, user input handling, loops, and 
   conditional statements.

 # Student Result Calculator in Java :
   This Java program calculates total marks, average percentage, and assigns grades based on user-inputted marks for multiple subjects. It begins by prompting the user to enter the number of subjects and their 
   respective marks. The CalculatetotalMarks method computes the sum of all marks, while CalculateAveragePercentage calculates the average percentage. Grades ('A' to 'F') are assigned using the AssignGrades method 
   based on the average percentage. Results are displayed using DisplayResults, showing total marks, average percentage, and the assigned grade for the student. This project showcases fundamental Java concepts such 
   as arrays, methods, conditional statements, and user input handling.

 # ATM Simulator in Java :
   This Java program simulates basic ATM functionalities using object-oriented principles. The BankAccount class manages account balance operations such as 
   depositing and withdrawing funds, while the AtmMachine class handles user interactions and displays ATM options like withdraw, deposit, check balance, and exit. 
   The program initializes with the user entering their initial account balance. It then allows continuous interaction where the user can choose from the displayed 
   options to perform transactions. This project showcases Java concepts such as classes, objects, methods, constructors, user input handling using Scanner, and 
   switch-case statements. It provides a practical example for learning basic banking operations and implementing them in a simulated environment.
